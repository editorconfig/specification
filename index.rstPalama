EditorConfig Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Introduction
============

EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers
working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig
project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection
of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere
to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely
with version control systems.

File Format
===========

EditorConfig uses an INI file format.
In an EditorConfig file (usually named ``.editorconfig``), all beginning
whitespace on each line is considered irrelevant. Each line must be one of the
following:

- Blank: contains only whitespace characters.
- Comment: starts with a ``;`` or a ``#``.
   - Inserting a ``#`` or ``;`` after non-whitespace characters in a line
     (i.e., inline) shall neither be parsed as a comment nor as part of the
     section name, pair (defined below) key or value in which it was inserted. This may change
     in the future; thus, is not recommended.
- Section Header: starts with a ``[`` and ends with a ``]``.
   - May not use any non-whitespace characters outside of the surrounding
     brackets.
   - May contain any characters between the square brackets (e.g.,
     ``[`` and ``]`` and even spaces and tabs are allowed).
   - Forward slashes (``/``) are used as path separators.
   - Backslashes (``\\``) are not allowed as path separators (even on Windows).
- Key-Value Pair (or Pair): contains a key and a value, separated by an `=`.
   - Key: the part before the first `=` (trimmed of whitespace).
   - Value: The part after the first `=` (trimmed of whitespace).

Any line that is not one of the above is invalid.

EditorConfig files should be UTF-8 encoded, with LF or CRLF line separators.

Additionaly, EditorConfig defines the following terms:

- Preamble: the lines that precedes the first section. The preamble is optional
  and may contain key-value pairs, comments and blank lines.
- Section Name: the string between the beginning ``[`` and the ending ``]``.
- Section: the lines starting from a Section Header until the beginning of
  the next Section Header or the end of the file.

Glob Expressions
================

Section names in EditorConfig files are filepath globs, similar to the format
accepted by ``.gitignore``. They support pattern matching through Unix
shell-style wildcards. These filepath globs recognize the following as
special characters for wildcard matching:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Special Characters
     - Matching
   * - ``*``
     - any string of characters, except path separators (``/``)
   * - ``**``
     - any string of characters
   * - ``?``
     - any single character, except path separators (``/``)
   * - ``[seq]``
     - any single character in seq
   * - ``[!seq]``
     - any single character not in seq
   * - ``{s1,s2,s3}``
     - any of the strings given (separated by commas, can be nested)
   * - ``{num1..num2}``
     - any integer numbers between ``num1`` and ``num2``, where ``num1`` and ``num2``
       can be either positive or negative

The backslash character (``\\``) can be used to escape a character so it is
not interpreted as a special character.

The maximum length of a section name is 4096 characters. All sections
exceeding this limit are ignored.

File Processing
===============

When a filename is given to EditorConfig a search is performed in the
directory of the given file and all parent directories for an EditorConfig
file (named ".editorconfig" by default). Non-existing directories are treated
as if they exist and are empty. All found EditorConfig files are
searched for sections with section names matching the given filename. The
search shall stop if an EditorConfig file is found with the ``root``
key set to ``true`` in the preamble or when reaching the root
filesystem directory.

Files are read top to bottom and the most recent rules found take
precedence. If multiple EditorConfig files have matching sections, the rules
from the closer EditorConfig file are read last, so pairs in closer
files take precedence.

Supported Pairs
===============

EditorConfig file sections contain key-value pairs separated by an
equal sign (``=``). With the exception of the ``root`` key, all pairs MUST be
located under a section to take effect. EditorConfig plugins shall ignore
unrecognized keys and invalid/unsupported values for those keys.

Here is the list of all keys understood by EditorConfig and the
supported values associated with them:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0

   * - ``indent_style``
     - Set to ``tab`` or ``space`` to use hard tabs or soft tabs respectively. The
       values are case insensitive.
   * - ``indent_size``
     - Set to a whole number defining the number of columns used for each
       indentation level and the width of soft tabs (when supported). If this
       equals ``tab``, the ``indent_size`` shall be set to the tab size, which
       should be ``tab_width`` (if specified); else, the tab size set by the
       editor. The values are case insensitive.
   * - ``tab_width``
     - Set to a whole number defining the number of columns used to represent
       a tab character. This defaults to the value of ``indent_size`` and should
       not usually need to be specified.
   * - ``end_of_line``
     - Set to ``lf``, ``cr``, or ``crlf`` to control how line breaks are
       represented. The values are case insensitive.
   * - ``charset``
     - Set to ``latin1``, ``utf-8``, ``utf-8-bom``, ``utf-16be`` or ``utf-16le`` to
       control the character set. Use of ``utf-8-bom`` is discouraged.
   * - ``trim_trailing_whitespace``
     - Set to ``true`` to remove all whitespace characters preceeding newline
       characters in the file and ``false`` to ensure it doesn't.
   * - ``insert_final_newline``
     - Set to ``true`` ensure file ends with a newline when saving and ``false``
       to ensure it doesn't.
   * - ``root``
     - Must be specified in the preamble. Set to ``true`` to stop the
       ``.editorconfig`` file search on the current file. The value is case
       insensitive.

For any pair, a value of ``unset`` removes the effect of that
pair, even if it has been set before. For example, add ``indent_size =
unset`` to undefine the ``indent_size`` pair (and use editor defaults).

Pair keys are case insensitive. All keys are lowercased after parsing.
The maximum length of a pair key is 50 characters and the maximum length
of a pair value is 255 characters. Any key or value beyond these limits
shall be ignored.
